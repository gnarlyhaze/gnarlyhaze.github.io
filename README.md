## Welcome to my project webpage!

My name is Nathan Clifford and this webpage is a collection of data, codes, and images for my PiHive project.

The project is an integration of modern technology into the art of
beekeeping. Using a Raspberry Pi computer the system is able to monitor the beehive temperature 
and humidity both during the summer and winter, and is capable of being used in remote off-grid 
locations by utilizing solar panels. The system is also capable of taking photos/video from within the 
beehive which removes the guess work of waiting for spring to check on the colony health. 

The value of this project is aimed towards the continuing health of honeybees, beehive products, and
pollinator-dependent agriculture. Beekeeping has not evolved much since the Langstroth hive was designed
with removable frames. This project intends to refresh the practice of beekeeping with modern technology that
assists in monitoring honeybee health in response to the recent challenges that have been facing bees (and 
beekeepers) worldwide.

The PiHive project is in its first year with the first prototype having been designed over the summer, and installed in Fall 2017.

### Prototype 1.0 
![Picture3](/011.JPG)

- Based on a Raspberry Pi Zero W, which is solar powered, and includes a PiNoIR Camera, and a DHT22 Temperature Humidity Sensor. It was installed in Hive 1 (the purple hive on the left) on 10_03_2017.

### The First Video Clip
<video src="026.mp4" width="1024" height="576" controls preload></video>

- The footage is somewhat fuzzy because the fixed focus camera has not been [adjusted](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3518) yet, and the IR LEDs are reflecting off the plastic lens which is keeping the bees outside of the top cover housing the equipment.
- There were also issues with the metal outter cover lid cutting off the wifi, as it seemed to present too much interference for the onboard Raspberry Pi Zero W's antenna and the range at which I was using the Wifi network.

- Also based on a Raspberry Pi Zero but this time I've elected to go for the model [without onboard WiFi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2885). The reasoning for this is the Pi [LAN cards' specified operating temperature](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#performanceOperatingTemperature) is simply not "rated" for the temperatures reached in our Canadian winters. To resolve this issue I've connected the Pi Zero to the [RedBear IOT pHAT](https://redbear.cc/product/iot-phat.html) which can be connected to a much longer wifi antenna and has an operating temperature rated [down to -30˚C](https://github.com/redbear/IoT_pHAT) 
- I've also had to exchange the solar charging system for an extension cable due to having discovered that the chemical properties of fast charging LiPo batteries below 0˚C cause the battery to permanently plate with lithium (and ruin the battery). [More on this here](http://www.switchdoc.com/2017/08/suncontrol-solar-controller-lipo-temperature-charging-control/).
- I've been able to add a [thermal camera](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3538) which I'm hoping will capture some interesting images of the bee cluster during winter. 

PiHive version 2.0 was installed 12/24/2017.
